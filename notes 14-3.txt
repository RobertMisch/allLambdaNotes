notes 14-3
trees are good at storing nested data that has both width and depth
our computer file system is one prominant system that uses a tree structure

trees similar to linked list, you have access to the root, and you go down and search through them

trees always follow some structure, for our number tree, low values go left, high values go right

what about equal values?
-dont handle them
-have all duplicates go to one side all the time. <-better to do

the ability to search with bts is really strong

to normally look through a normal list, runtime is O(n)
to search through a binary search tree is O(log(n))
