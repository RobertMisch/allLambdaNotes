linked list workshop notes
-matt meyers, facebook guy that teaches some technical interview stuff

adv of linked list. arrays are predetermined sizes, while linked lists can be any size. much better on memory management. the node can be anywhere in memory as long as the pointers are correct

it's also very effecient at adding to the first spot. arrays very inefficient at shifts

remember uper

figure out the problem
